# Autonomous Vehicle Detection Using YOLOv8
## Introduction
Autonomous vehicles are a crucial part of modern transportation systems, requiring robust detection mechanisms to ensure safety and efficiency. This project leverages YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8), a state-of-the-art object detection model, to detect vehicles in real-time with high accuracy and low latency.

## Objectives
- Develop an autonomous vehicle detection system using the YOLOv8 model.
- Achieve high detection accuracy and real-time performance.
- Provide an easy-to-use framework for training and inference.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** Gather a diverse set of vehicle images from various sources to ensure the model can generalize well.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Annotate the collected images in the required format (e.g., COCO, Pascal VOC).
3. **Model Training:** Train the YOLOv8 model on the prepared dataset, fine-tuning the hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on a separate validation set to ensure it meets the desired accuracy and speed.
5. **Deployment:** Develop an inference pipeline to deploy the model for real-time vehicle detection.

## Results
The YOLOv8 model achieved impressive results on the test dataset, demonstrating high accuracy and real-time performance. The model was able to detect vehicles in various environments, including different lighting conditions and occlusions.
